                            Hi, I’m Adewale Kemi, the author and recipe developer at
                            kemiskitchen.com; a food blog which features delicious, family
                            friendly recipes with thoroughly detailed step-by-step preparation
                            methods, supported with accurate photos.<br><br>
                            
                            How did I get here? Well, I’ve always been very passionate about 
                            writing but it never occurred to me to start a blog before now, though 
                            I was always nudged by friends to do so. My passion for cooking and 
                            developing recipes began earlier this year. I recently changed jobs 
                            and I’m allowed to work from home most times. Not being used to staying 
                            at home all day, I got really bored and decided to spruce up my cooking 
                            skills to while away time, well,  let’s just say I became utterly obsessed
                             with cooking. I took to posting photos of foods I’d prepared on Facebook and 
                             Instagram, consequently, friends and followers began to implore me to start
                            blogging so they could keep up with recipes, After several persuasions, 
                            I finally decided to marry my two passions. <br><br>
                            
                            Here, you’ll find meal preparation instructions for mouth watering dishes delivered 
                            with utmost ease and simplicity, so stay tuned. <br><br>
                            This is an interactive blog so I’m open to food ideas, suggestions as well as
                             constructive criticisms. Keep them coming but do bear in mind, this lady bruises easily…
